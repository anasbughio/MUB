            Welcome to the Cardiology Department at MUB Trust Hospital, where we are dedicated to providing the people of Mirpurkhas with comprehensive, high-quality heart care. Our team of experienced cardiologists offers a range of essential cardiac services, including outpatient consultations (OPD), echocardiograms, and Exercise Tolerance Tests (ETT). In addition, we provide emergency care for heart-related crises and specialized treatment for heart failure patients.

At present, our focus is on non-invasive cardiac care, ensuring that each patient receives personalized attention and treatment based on their specific needs. Our state-of-the-art diagnostic tools and compassionate approach enable us to effectively diagnose, manage, and monitor a wide range of heart conditions.

While we currently do not offer interventional cardiology, our vision for the future is ambitious. Plans are underway to expand our services with the introduction of interventional cardiology, electrophysiology (EP) studies, and the creation of a specialized Coronary Care Unit (CCU). In addition, we are preparing to offer cardiac surgery, which will allow us to treat even the most complex heart conditions right here in Mirpurkhas.

With these advancements, MUB Trust Hospital is committed to evolving into a fully equipped cardiology center that can provide the community with comprehensive heart careâ€”ranging from routine diagnostics to advanced, life-saving procedures. Our mission is to continue growing while maintaining the highest standards of care, ensuring that no patient is left behind due to financial or geographical limitations.
